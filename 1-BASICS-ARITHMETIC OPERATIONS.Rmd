Let us start with some basic mathematical operations we
learnt in childhood to get familiar with R

addition
```{r} 
1+2
```


subtraction
```{r} 
5-3
```

multiplication
```{r} 
9*7
``` 

division
```{r} 
5/8
```

exponent
```{r} 
4^6
```

modulo
```{r} 
5 %% 2 
```


order of operations
```{r} 
100*2+50/2  
```


same answer
```{r} 
(100*2)+(50/2) 
```
